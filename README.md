# Project made by Antoine MORTELIER & Logan CHENAVIER

# E-Commerce API

This API was made on Spring for a school project.
It is a simulation on a e-commerce, you can create an account, articles, make command and buy it.
There is a few logical sequence to follow in the requests :

- You can't access to the requests as long as you are not logged in (you can access to the catalog and the account creation anyway).
- You can't buy a command if a command doesn't exist yet. Create a command first, buy it then.

The Auth0 security doesn't work yet, I couldn't make the link between the access token and the API.

## Insomnia

All the test requests are in ./api/e-commerce.json, you can import it on Insomnia.
